# gee-workgroup
Google Earth Engine Workgroup

This is intended to get you into GEE by working on your own project code, discussing and debugging.

Weekly in-person meetings in lab every Friday at 10 am.

## Tasks for next meeting:
1. Keep working with the basics, start your own code, check the resources posted below, and bring your questions.
2. Alternatively, if you feel lost and don't know where to start you can work on: how to create a mosaic, get mean values, write a function, mask lands or clouds, etc...
3. Check the google doc posted above and revisit the codes we worked with in last session.

I'd like you to bring specific questions and some code that we can work with. It is dificult for me to cover topics thal all can follow if I do not know what you really need to learn, remember we have beginners and others already working with on GEE.
