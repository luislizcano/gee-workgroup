# gee-workgroup
Google Earth Engine Workgroup [private]

This is intended to get you into GEE by working on your own project code, discussing and debugging.

## Projects
Current members and projects:

| members   | project
| --------- | -----------------
| Chelsea   | Coral reef mapping in FL Keys

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tasks for next meeting:
For everyone:
1. Identify the type of dataset/imagery needed
2. Try to import dataset and filter by study area and time
3. Add layers to map

<b>Bonus:</b> Get familiar with common types of variables (e.g. ee.Image, ee.ImageCollection, ee.Feature) and ee functions (e.g. print(), Map.addLayer, ee.Filter, etc)
